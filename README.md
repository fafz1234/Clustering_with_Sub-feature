# Clustering_with_Sub-feature
This projects presents an approach to better identify the clusters within a dataset while performing 
unsupervised Machine Learning. It mainly uses the KMeans for the underlying clustering tasks. 
It can be seen that by dividing the original feature space into a structure-set and noise-set, it is possible 
to obtain a clear cluster structure while simultaneously performing dimensionality reduction. The structure-set 
is an m-dimensional space that contains all the structural information of the clusters. The noise-set contains 
all other feature sets that do not have any information that is relevant to the clustering.
